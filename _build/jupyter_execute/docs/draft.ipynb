    "# Correlation between Happiness and Economic Factors \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data analysis will focus on exploring the correlation between happiness and economic factors. Using the \"World Happiness Report\" dataset and relevant economic indicators such as GDP per capita, inflation rates, and consumer price index (CPI), we will investigate the relationship between subjective well-being and economic stability. By analyzing the data, we aim to determine whether countries with higher economic indicators tend to exhibit higher happiness scores. This study will contribute to our understanding of how economic factors influence individual and societal levels of happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perspectives\n",
    "1. Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Happiness: We want to examine the impact of\n",
    "CPI on happiness. We will argue that a higher CPI, reflecting increased prices of\n",
    "goods and services, could potentially reduce individuals' satisfaction with their\n",
    "standard of living, impacting overall happiness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inflation Rates and Happiness: We want to investigate the relationship between\n",
    "inflation rates and happiness. We will argue that high inflation rates may lead to\n",
    "increased uncertainty, economic instability, and decreased purchasing power,\n",
    "potentially negatively affecting happiness levels in a country.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GDP per Capita and Happiness: We will explore the correlation between GDP per\n",
    "capita and happiness scores. We will argue that countries with higher GDP per\n",
    "capita may have better economic opportunities, access to resources, and quality of\n",
    "life, which could positively impact happiness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets and preprocessing\n",
    "We decided to use the World Happiness Dataset from WHO. For our second dataset, we wanted to use a dataset about inflation trends from (at least) ten years ago up until 2022. We found an inflation dataset from OECD data that matched our requirements. We then analysed the two datasets and came to the conclusion that we needed a more comprehensive dataset for the happiness measurement, because it only contained data for the year 2019. To make accurate analyses, the dataset has to match the time periods of the other. Also, the inflation dataset can possibly give us interesting visualisations because of the inflation trends before, during and (somewhat) after the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",

    "**Description:** This dataset is from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and focuses on inflation, specifically the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Consumer Price Index is a widely used measure of inflation, representing the average price change over time for a basket of goods and services commonly consumed by households.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset likely includes information about inflation rates for various countries and regions over a specific time period. It can provide insights into how prices of goods and services have changed over time, serving as an important indicator of economic stability and the purchasing power of consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing this dataset, we can gain a deeper understanding of inflation trends across different economies and regions. We could also compare the inflation rates of different countries to assess their economic performance, identify periods of high or low inflation, and study the potential impacts on various sectors such as investment, wages, and consumer spending.\n",

    "- Are there privacy or ethical issues in the data?\n",
    "- Is it practical to process the variable that we want?\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent our dataset to be too large, we decided to analyse the data for the years 2020 and 2022, because both datasets' values varied a lot in between these years. Another reason for the selection of only two different years is that we want to find out how much the data can differ in such a small timeframe.\n",

    "Looking at the charts of both 2020 and 2022, for most countries it is true that those with a high happiness score also appear to have a high GDP, and vice versa. Thus, these visualization support the idea that a high GDP per capita will have a positive effect on the overall happiness of the population. For example, India has both the lowest happiness score and lowest GDP per capita, and Switzerland has both the highest happiness score and the highest GDP per capita. This is true for both graphs.\n",
